# Inos â€“ The Internet Native Operating System

> **ðŸš§ Work in Progress (WIP):**  
> INOS is a fast-evolving, open platform for distributed, AI-powered, and WASM-enabled systems. We welcome contributors of all backgroundsâ€”Go developers, AI/ML engineers, database and distributed systems specialists, QA/testers, frontend and WASM enthusiasts, and anyone passionate about building resilient, extensible digital infrastructure. See the Contributing section below to get involved!

Welcome to **Inos**â€”a self-documenting, AI-ready, and community-driven platform for orchestrating digital services, relationships, and value.

## What is Inos?

**Inos** (Internet Native Operating System) is a modular, event-driven platform for orchestrating digital services, relationships, and value across the internet. It provides a unified substrate for identity, data, and interface interoperabilityâ€”bridging backend, real-time, and frontend layers.

---

## Architecture Overview

INOS is built on a layered, modern architecture:

```text
Go Services (Domain Logic, gRPC APIs)
        â”‚
        â–¼
gRPC Service Mesh (Internal APIs, Service-to-Service)
        â”‚
        â–¼
Event Bus (Redis + Custom) & WebSockets (Real-Time)
        â”‚
        â–¼
Multithreaded WASM (AI/ML, Compute, Browser/Edge)
        â”‚
        â–¼
Frontend (React, TypeScript, SPA, PWA)
```

### **Key Components**

- **Go Services:** Modular, domain-driven microservices (user, campaign, content, analytics, etc.) expose gRPC APIs and business logic.
- **gRPC Mesh:** High-performance, strongly-typed APIs for internal and external service communication.
- **Event Bus & WebSockets:** Real-time orchestration, pub/sub, and campaign/user-specific messaging. Enables live updates, notifications, and cross-service workflows.
- **Multithreaded WASM:** High-performance AI/ML and compute modules running in the browser or edge, interoperating with backend services.
- **Frontend:** Modern, reactive UI (React/TypeScript) consuming real-time data and WASM-powered features.

---

## Metadata: The Systemâ€™s DNA

- **Universal Ledger:** Metadata is the core currency and audit trail of INOS, tracking every operation, relationship, and value flowâ€”across users, services, content, and tasks.
- **Extensibility:** All services, events, and entities are described and orchestrated via extensible metadata, enabling dynamic evolution without breaking existing data.
- **Lineage & Provenance:** Every entity and action is traceable, supporting audit, compliance, and digital legacy.
- **System Currency:** The sum of all scores and values across the system forms a living, auditable measure of reputation, contribution, and impact.

---

## Graceful Orchestration: Error & Success as First-Class Citizens

- **Centralized Handling:** All errors and successes are orchestrated via the `graceful` package, ensuring that every outcomeâ€”positive or negativeâ€”is logged, auditable, and can trigger further automation.
- **Extensible Hooks:** Custom hooks and overrides allow for service-specific or advanced orchestration, supporting resilience and compliance.
- **Symmetry:** Both error and success flows are handled with equal care, enabling robust, predictable, and transparent system behavior.

---

## Features

- Metadata-centric, self-documenting architecture
- Extensible connectors for people, services, compliance, and more
- Digital will pattern for legacy and allocation
- Accessibility and compliance built-in

## Database & Redis Practices

- **PostgreSQL:**  
  - Uses `jsonb` columns for rich, extensible metadata  
  - Full-text search, GIN/partial indexes for performance  
  - Partitioning, archiving, and audit trails for scalability
- **Redis:**  
  - Hot data caching for low-latency access  
  - Pub/sub for real-time events and notifications  
  - Rate limiting, counters, and ephemeral state

---

## Handlers, Nexus, and Orchestration Patterns

- **Handlers:** REST, gRPC, and WebSocket handlers translate external requests into canonical metadata-driven actions.
- **Nexus:** The event bus and orchestration layer connect all services, adapters, and real-time flows, enabling dynamic, metadata-driven automation.
- **Bridge/Adapters:** Protocol adapters (MQTT, WebSocket, etc.) enable integration with any external system or device.

## Why INOS is the Internet Native Operating System

- The internet lacks a shared user context â€” INOS fixes this.
- Users own their profiles and move seamlessly across apps.
- Developers build interoperable frontends and shared backends.
- INOS provides standards for memory, interfaces, and control in network-native environments.
- Metadata is the backbone: every action, relationship, and value flow is tracked, auditable, and programmable.
- Graceful orchestration ensures robust, transparent, and resilient system behavior for both errors and successes.

**INOS is the OS for the programmable, AI-native, internet-scale future.**
