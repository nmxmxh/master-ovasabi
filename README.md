# Inos: The Internet-Native OS

> **ðŸš§ Work in Progress (WIP):**  
> Inos is an actively evolving platform. We are seeking collaboration from Go engineers, database
> specialists, QA/test engineers, and anyone passionate about building robust, extensible digital
> systems. If you're interested in shaping the future of this platform, your contributions and ideas
> are welcomeâ€”see the Contributing section below!

> **ðŸš€ Launching the Internet-Native OS:**  
> A distributed, device-agnostic, and scalable operating system for the post-platform era â€” powered
> by Go, WASM, WebGPU, and DAG orchestration.

Welcome to **Inos**â€”a self-documenting, AI-ready, and community-driven platform for orchestrating
digital services, relationships, and value.

---

## What is Inos?

**Inos** is more than a backendâ€”it's a living ecosystem for modern digital products, powered by a
robust, metadata-driven knowledge graph (Amadeus). Every service, relationship, and capability is
continuously documented, orchestrated, and made accessible to both humans and AI.

## Philosophy

See [docs/amadeus/manifesto.md](docs/amadeus/manifesto.md) for the full manifesto and advice. In
short: simplicity, extensibility, fairness, and digital legacy are at the heart of everything we do.

## Latest Standards & Innovations

- **Metadata as System Currency:** Metadata is the universal ledger and currency of OVASABI,
  tracking value, reputation, and contributions across users, services, content, and tasks.
- **System-Wide Timezone Awareness:** All events, transactions, and metadata updates are timestamped
  and normalized for global consistency (TimezoneZ).
- **System Currency Explorer:** A tool (UI/API) for visualizing and analyzing the total value,
  contributions, and flows within the ecosystem.
- **User, Service, and Task Scores:** Every entity can have its own score, history, and value,
  contributing to the living system currency.
- **Dual Licensing:** OVASABI is available under the MIT License for open source use and a
  commercial license for enterprise features, support, and additional guarantees.
- **Canonical/Hosted Platform:** The hosted version of OVASABI is the de facto source of truth for
  standards, updates, and governance.

## Metadata (System Currency & Extensibility)

- **Universal Ledger:** Metadata tracks every operation, service, and relationship, making it
  possible to value and reward all forms of participationâ€”human or machine.
- **Lineage and Provenance:** Every entity, fork, and contribution is traceable via the `lineage`
  field and audit trails.
- **Extensible Patterns:** New fields, services, and value flows can be added without breaking
  existing data or requiring disruptive migrations.
- **System Currency:** The sum of all scores and values across the system forms a living, auditable
  measure of reputation, contribution, and impact.
- **See:** [docs/services/metadata.md](docs/services/metadata.md),
  [docs/amadeus/amadeus_context.md](docs/amadeus/amadeus_context.md)

## Graceful Orchestration (Error & Success)

- **Centralized Handling:** All errors and successes are handled via the `graceful` package,
  orchestrating post-action flows (logging, audit, cache, events) automatically and symmetrically.
- **Extensible Hooks:** Custom hooks and overrides allow for service-specific or advanced
  orchestration.
- **Auditability:** Every outcome is logged and auditable, supporting resilience and compliance.
- **See:** [pkg/graceful/](pkg/graceful/),
  [docs/amadeus/amadeus_context.md#platform-standard-graceful-error-and-success-handling](docs/amadeus/amadeus_context.md#platform-standard-graceful-error-and-success-handling)

## Database & Redis Practices

- **PostgreSQL:**
  - Use `jsonb` columns for rich, extensible metadata
  - Full-text search, GIN/partial indexes for performance
  - Partitioning, archiving, and audit trails for scalability
- **Redis:**
  - Hot data caching for low-latency access
  - Pub/sub for real-time events and notifications
  - Rate limiting, counters, and ephemeral state
- **See:** [docs/development/database_practices.md](docs/development/database_practices.md),
  [docs/development/redis_practices.md](docs/development/redis_practices.md)

## Handlers, Nexus, and Orchestration Patterns

- **Handlers:** REST, gRPC, and WebSocket handlers translate external requests into canonical
  metadata-driven actions.
- **Nexus:** The event bus and orchestration layer connect all services, adapters, and real-time
  flows, enabling dynamic, metadata-driven automation.
- **Bridge/Adapters:** Protocol adapters (MQTT, WebSocket, etc.) enable integration with any
  external system or device.
- **See:** [internal/nexus/service/pattern/](internal/nexus/service/pattern/),
  [internal/nexus/service/bridge/](internal/nexus/service/bridge/)

## The OVASABI Thank You Tax

OVASABI is my digital willâ€”a living system, a manifesto, and a gift to the world. If you've found
value hereâ€”if this project has inspired you, saved you time, or sparked new ideasâ€”consider paying a
small "thank you tax."

This isn't a tax in the traditional sense. It's a gesture of gratitudeâ€”a way to say, _"I see you. I
appreciate the work. I want this legacy to grow."_

Your contribution helps me:

- Keep the lights on and the servers running
- Dedicate more time to building, documenting, and supporting the community
- Ensure OVASABI remains open, accessible, and evolving for everyone

**No amount is too small.** Every "thank you tax" is a vote for open knowledge, fairness, and
digital legacy.

If you'd like to contribute, you can do so here:

Thank you for being part of this journey. Let's keep buildingâ€”together.

â€” Nobert Momoh (OVASABI Creator)

## Dual Licensing

OVASABI is dual-licensed:

- **MIT License:** Free and open source for community use, contributions, and research. See
  [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Commercial License:** For enterprises or organizations needing additional features, support,
  SLAs, or legal guarantees. Contact us for commercial licensing options.

## System Currency Explorer (Work in Progress)

The System Currency Explorer visualizes and analyzes the total value, contributions, and flows
within OVASABI. It enables:

- Viewing the total system currency (sum of all metadata scores)
- Drilling down into users, services, and tasks to see their value and history
- Tracking value flows, tax, and rewards
- Auditing provenance and digital legacy

## Canonical/Hosted Platform

The hosted version of OVASABI is the canonical source of truth for standards, updates, and
governance. Forks and integrations inherit the metadata lineage, but the hosted platform sets the
reference for the ecosystem.
