# Super Knowledge Graph Configuration

This document details the advanced configuration and implementation of the OVASABI Knowledge Graph
system.

## Overview

The Super Knowledge Graph extends the base knowledge graph with advanced AI capabilities,
mathematical models, and research-driven improvements. It provides a comprehensive framework for
knowledge representation, reasoning, and AI integration.

## Core Components

### Embedding Models

1. **Default TransE Model**

   ```math
   d(h + r, t) = ||h + r - t||_2
   ```

   - Dimensions: 768
   - Purpose: Entity and relation representations
   - Application: Basic knowledge graph embeddings

2. **Advanced RotatE Model**

   ```math
   h \circ r = t, \text{where } r = e^{i\theta}
   ```

   - Dimensions: 1024
   - Purpose: Complex rotation in semantic space
   - Application: Advanced relationship modeling

### Querying Methods

1. **Graph Pattern Matching**

   ```math
   Q(G) = \pi_{vars}(\bowtie_{p \in P} match(p, G))
   ```

   - Algorithm: RDF\*
   - Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Use Cases: Pattern discovery, relationship inference

2. **Semantic Reasoning**

   P(h|q,t) = \sigma(f_\theta(h,q,t))
   ```

   - Algorithm: Neural Logic Programming
   - Parameters:
     - Temperature: 0.7
     - Max Depth: 5

### Perspective Awareness

1. **Contextual Embeddings**

   ```math
   E_{ctx} = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i T_i(E)
   ```

   - Type: MultiViewTransformer
   - Dimensions: 1024
   - Purpose: Multi-perspective knowledge representation

2. **Viewpoint Integration**

   ```math
   V_{integrated} = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V
   ```

   - Method: AttentionFusion
   - Application: Perspective merging and reconciliation

### Language Model Integration

1. **GPT-4 Integration**

   ```math
   Attn(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T + M_{kg}}{\sqrt{d_k}})V
   ```

   - Purpose: Natural language understanding
   - Method: KnowledgeAugmentedAttention

2. **BERT Integration**

   ```math
   E_{final} = \lambda E_{bert} + (1-\lambda)E_{kg}
   ```

   - Purpose: Entity linking
   - Method: EntityAwareEmbedding

## Implementation Guidelines

### Data Ingestion

- Sources: Financial transactions, User interactions, Market data, External knowledge bases
- Preprocessing:
- Entity Normalization: Canonical forms
- Relation Extraction: Hybrid neural-symbolic approach
- Temporal Alignment: UTC timestamp normalization

### Scaling Strategies

- Partitioning Method: GraphPartitioning (METIS)
- Complexity: O(|E| log |V|)

### Security Considerations

- Access Control: AttributeBasedAccessControl at SubgraphLevel
- Privacy Preservation: DifferentialPrivacy

  ```math
  \epsilon\text{-DP}: P(M(D) \in S) \leq e^{\epsilon} P(M(D') \in S)
  ```

## Research Extensions

### Proposed Improvements

1. **Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning**

   ```math
   E(t) = E_0 + \Delta E \cdot f(t)
   ```

   - Purpose: Incorporate temporal dynamics
   - Application: Time-aware embeddings

2. **Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Networks**

   ```math
   P(h|\mu, \Sigma) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)
   ```

   - Purpose: Risk assessment
   - Application: Probabilistic embeddings
