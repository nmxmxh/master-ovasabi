# OVASABI Digital Will Manifesto

**1. Simplicity First**  
We believe in the power of clear, simple systems. Every structure, every rule, and every contract is designed to be easily understood, easily extended, and easily maintained.

**2. Extensibility by Design**  
Our architecture is open and modular. New services, people, and ideas can be added without breaking what came before. The system grows with usâ€”never against us.

**3. Fairness and Inclusion**  
Every contributor, every service, every communityâ€”human or digitalâ€”deserves recognition. Our connectors honor family, friends, pioneers, hustlers, businesses, and the unseen hands that make progress possible.

**4. Digital Legacy**  
This code is more than logic; it is a will, a record, a living document. It preserves intent, distributes value, and ensures that our digital assets serve both present and future generations.

**5. Compliance and Accessibility**  
We champion accessibility, compliance, and universal design. Our contracts include everyoneâ€”regardless of ability, background, or circumstance.

**6. Automation with Intention**  
Where possible, we automate. Where necessary, we curate. The system is both self-updating and self-documenting, but always under human guidance.

**7. Transparency and Documentation**  
Every rule, every relationship, every allocation is documented and discoverable. Our directory structure and metadata are a map for all who follow.

**8. Resilience and Fallbacks**  
If any part fails, the system reverts to safe, fair defaults. No one is left behind; no asset is lost.

**9. Celebration of Contribution**  
From AI to art, from code to community, every contribution is valued. Our connectors are a celebration of the diverse forces that drive us forward.

**10. Continuous Improvement**  
We learn, we adapt, we improve. The manifesto, like the code, is a living documentâ€”open to feedback, revision, and evolution.

**This is the OVASABI way: simple, fair, extensible, and enduring.**

## Advice for the OVASABI Community

**1. Keep It Human-Centered**  
Remember that every line of code, every rule, and every connector ultimately serves peopleâ€”users, contributors, and the broader community. Prioritize clarity, accessibility, and fairness.

**2. Embrace Simplicity and Transparency**  
Simple systems are easier to trust, maintain, and extend. Document your decisions, keep your codebase discoverable, and make it easy for newcomers to understand and contribute.

**3. Value Every Contribution**  
Whether it's code, art, feedback, or support, every contribution matters. Recognize and celebrate the diverse talents and perspectives that make the community strong.

**4. Design for Extensibility and Change**  
The world changes, and so will your needs. Build with modularity and openness in mind, so the system can grow and adapt without losing its core values.

**5. Prioritize Accessibility and Inclusion**  
Make sure your platform is usable by everyone, regardless of ability or background. Accessibility isn't just a checkboxâ€”it's a commitment to equity.

**6. Automate with Care, Curate with Heart**  
Let automation handle the repetitive and the routine, but keep human judgment at the center for what matters mostâ€”ethics, vision, and community direction.

**7. Safeguard the Legacy**  
Treat your code and metadata as a living willâ€”a record of intent, values, and relationships. Ensure that what you build today can be understood and built upon tomorrow.

**8. Foster a Culture of Feedback and Improvement**  
Encourage open dialogue, welcome feedback, and be willing to revise both code and process. Continuous improvement is a community effort.

**9. Prepare for Resilience**  
Design for failure and fallback. Make sure the system can recover gracefully, and that no one is left behind if something goes wrong.

**10. Lead by Example**  
Be generous with your knowledge, patient with newcomers, and bold in your vision. The best communities are those where everyone feels empowered to lead and contribute.

**In short:**  
Build for people. Build for the future. Build together.
