# OVASABI Open Source Release Note

Today, I'm releasing the OVASABI platform to the world—not just as a finished product, but as a living record of my journey, my thoughts, and my intent.

This project is more than code. It's a digital will, a social contract, and a manifesto for how we can build systems that are simple, fair, and enduring. Every connector, every pattern, and every comment reflects a commitment to openness, inclusion, and legacy.

I invite you to explore not just the logic, but the philosophy behind it. See the [manifesto](manifesto.md) and [advice](manifesto.md#advice-for-the-ovasabi-community) for the values that guide this work.

This release is an invitation:

- To learn from my progress, my decisions, and even my mistakes
- To contribute your own ideas, code, and creativity
- To help shape a platform that grows with its community

Whether you're a developer, a dreamer, or just curious, you are welcome here. Let's build something meaningful—together.

— OVASABI Creator
