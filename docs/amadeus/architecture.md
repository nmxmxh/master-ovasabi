## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. Technology Stack

The Amadeus system is implemented using the following technologies:

- **Go**: Programming language for all components
- **JSON**: Data format for knowledge graph storage
- **Sync Package**: For thread-safe access to the knowledge graph
- **Context Package**: For context propagation in service hooks
- **Flag Package**: For CLI tool parameter handling

### 4.2. Concurrency Model

The Knowledge Graph API uses a reader-writer mutex to ensure thread-safe access:

- **Read operations**: Multiple concurrent reads allowed
- **Write operations**: Exclusive access during writes
- **API design**: Methods handle locking internally

### 4.3. File Storage

The knowledge graph is stored as a JSON file with the following characteristics:

- **Location**: `amadeus/knowledge_graph.json`
- **Format**: Indented JSON for human readability
- **Versioning**: Git-based version control for history tracking
- **Timestamp**: Last updated timestamp for change tracking

### 4.4. Integration Points

#### 4.4.1. Service Integration

Services integrate with the knowledge graph through service hooks:

```go
// During service initialization
serviceHook := NewServiceHook("service_name", "category")
serviceHook.OnServiceStart(ctx)

// When adding endpoints
serviceHook.OnEndpointAdded(ctx, "endpoint_name", metadata)

// When adding dependencies
serviceHook.OnDependencyAdded(ctx, "dependency_type", "dependency_name")
```

#### 4.4.2. Nexus Integration

Nexus integrates with the knowledge graph through patterns:

```go
// Register the knowledge graph pattern
kgPattern := pattern.NewKnowledgeGraphPattern()
nexuspattern.Registry().Register("knowledge_graph_pattern", kgPattern)

// Execute knowledge graph operations
params := map[string]interface{}{
    "action": "track_service_update",
    // Additional parameters
}
result, err := nexuspattern.Registry().Execute(ctx, "knowledge_graph_pattern", params)
```

#### 4.4.3. CLI Integration

The CLI tool interfaces with the knowledge graph API:

```go
// Get knowledge from the graph
knowledgeGraph := kg.DefaultKnowledgeGraph()
node, err := knowledgeGraph.GetNode("path.to.node")

// Add a service to the graph
err := knowledgeGraph.AddService("category", "name", serviceInfo)
```

## 5. Deployment Architecture

### 5.1. Component Distribution

The Amadeus system is distributed throughout the OVASABI platform:

3. **Visualization Generation**: Generate updated visualizations
4. **Documentation Deployment**: Deploy updated documentation

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1. Memory Usage

The knowledge graph is designed to be memory-efficient:

- **Lazy Loading**: Graph is loaded on first access
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance shared across the application
- **Structured JSON**: Efficient JSON representation

### 6.2. File I/O

File I/O is optimized to minimize overhead:

- **Infrequent Writes**: Graph is only written when changes occur
- **Atomic Updates**: File updates are performed atomically
- **Directory Creation**: Ensure directories exist before writing

### 6.3. Concurrency

Concurrency is handled to ensure safe access:

- **Reader-Writer Mutex**: Allows concurrent reads
- **Context Propagation**: All operations accept a context parameter
- **Goroutine Safety**: All API methods are safe for concurrent use

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1. Access Control

Access to the knowledge graph is controlled through:

- **File System Permissions**: Restricts who can modify the knowledge graph file
- **API Access**: Knowledge graph API included only in authorized services
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Controlled updates through the CI/CD process

### 7.2. Sensitive Information

The knowledge graph is designed to avoid storing sensitive information:

- **No Credentials**: No credentials or secrets in the knowledge graph
- **No Personal Data**: No personal or user data in the knowledge graph
- **Implementation Focus**: Focus on architecture, not implementation details

## 8. Scalability

### 8.1. Knowledge Graph Size

The knowledge graph is designed to scale with the system:

- **Structured Sections**: Logically organized sections for better scalability
- **Selective Loading**: API supports loading specific sections
- **Pagination**: CLI tools support paginated output for large sections

### 8.2. Service Count

The system scales with increasing service count:

- **Independent Service Registration**: Services register independently
- **Distributed Updates**: Updates originate from individual services
- **Relationship Tracking**: Relationships scale with entity count

## 9. Resilience

### 9.1. Error Handling

Errors are handled gracefully throughout the system:

- **Defensive Loading**: Graph loads safely even with missing sections
- **Error Propagation**: Errors are properly wrapped and propagated
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults when information is missing

### 9.2. Data Integrity

Data integrity is maintained through:

- **File Backup**: Knowledge graph file is backed up before updates
