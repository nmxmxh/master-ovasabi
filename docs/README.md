# Inos: Living Knowledge Platform

version: 2025-06-01

Welcome to **Inos**—a self-documenting, AI-ready, and community-driven platform for orchestrating
digital services, relationships, and value.

---

## What is Inos?

**Inos** is more than a backend—it's a living ecosystem for modern digital products, powered by a
robust, metadata-driven knowledge graph (Amadeus). Every service, relationship, and capability is
continuously documented, orchestrated, and made accessible to both humans and AI.

- **Self-Documenting:** Every service, schema, and relationship is tracked and visualized in the
  Amadeus Knowledge Graph.
- **Extensible by Design:** Add new services, features, or integrations without breaking what came
  before.
- **Fair and Transparent:** All value flows, contributions, and rewards are tracked in
  metadata—forming a universal ledger for the ecosystem.
- **Community-First:** Built for the community, by the community. Every contribution is recognized
  and valued.
