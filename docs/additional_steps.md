# Advanced Resilience and Orchestration: Nexus-Driven Integration

This section describes how to integrate four advanced microservices patterns—circuit breaking,
workflow engine, service mesh, and chaos testing—using the Nexus event bus as the central
orchestrator. By making these patterns event-driven and Nexus-aware, the platform achieves unified
observability, automated remediation, and system-wide resilience.

---

## 1. Circuit Breaking (Nexus Integration)

- **Implementation:**
  - Add circuit breaker middleware (e.g., sony/gobreaker) to all outbound service calls.
  - On circuit breaker state changes (open/close), emit `nexus.circuit_breaker.tripped` or
    `nexus.circuit_breaker.reset` events with metadata (service, dependency, error, timestamp).
  - Nexus listens for these events to trigger alerts, dynamic policy updates, or compensating
    workflows.
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents cascading failures, provides real-time system health visibility, and enables automated
    failover or rerouting.

## 2. Workflow Engine (Saga/Orchestration) with Nexus

- **Implementation:**
  - Integrate a workflow engine (e.g., Temporal) that uses Nexus for event emission and consumption.
  - Each workflow step emits a `nexus.workflow.step.completed` or `nexus.workflow.step.failed`
    event.
  - Nexus advances the workflow, triggers compensations, or escalates errors based on event
    outcomes.
- **Benefits:**
  - Ensures reliable, traceable, and compensating distributed transactions. Enables real-time
    monitoring and audit of business processes.

## 3. Service Mesh (Nexus-Aware)

- **Implementation:**
  - Deploy a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) at the infrastructure level.
  - Mesh proxies emit events to Nexus (e.g., `nexus.mesh.traffic.routed`,
    `nexus.mesh.mtls.failure`).
  - Nexus can trigger mesh policy updates, traffic rerouting, or security escalations in response to
    mesh events.
- **Benefits:**
  - Achieves zero-trust security, advanced traffic management, and unified observability across the
    platform.

## 4. Chaos Testing (Event-Driven by Nexus)

- **Implementation:**
  - Use chaos engineering tools (e.g., chaos-mesh, Gremlin) to inject failures and emit
    `nexus.chaos.inject.failure` events.
  - Nexus coordinates chaos experiments, monitors system response, and triggers automated recovery
    or rollback workflows.
- **Benefits:**
  - Validates system resilience, surfaces hidden weaknesses, and enables continuous improvement
    through orchestrated chaos.

## Unified Event Flows (Examples)

- **Circuit Breaker:**
  - Service → (breaker trips) → `nexus.circuit_breaker.tripped` → Nexus → (alert, reroute, trigger
    workflow)
- **Workflow Step:**
  - Service → (step complete) → `nexus.workflow.step.completed` → Nexus → (advance workflow, trigger
    next step)
- **Mesh Failure:**
  - Mesh proxy → (mTLS fail) → `nexus.mesh.mtls.failure` → Nexus → (alert, update mesh policy)
- **Chaos Injection:**
  - Chaos tool → (inject fault) → `nexus.chaos.inject.failure` → Nexus → (monitor, trigger recovery)

---

## Why Use Nexus as the Central Orchestrator?

- **Centralized Orchestration:** Coordinates responses to failures, workflow steps, mesh events, and
  chaos experiments.
- **Real-Time Observability:** Aggregates all critical events for rapid diagnosis and response.
- **Automated Remediation:** Triggers workflows, policy changes, or compensations in response to
  system events.
- **Extensibility:** Supports future patterns (A/B testing, feature flags, scaling) on the same
  event-driven foundation.

**By integrating these patterns through Nexus, the platform achieves a new level of resilience,
automation, and operational intelligence.**
