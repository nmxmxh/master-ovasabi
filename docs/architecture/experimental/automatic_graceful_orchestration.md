# Automatic, Symmetrical Orchestration Pattern (Graceful Success & Error)

## Overview

This section documents the canonical, thesis-level orchestration pattern implemented in the OVASABI
platform using the `graceful` package. It enables fully automatic, DRY, and symmetrical
orchestration for both success and error flows, with extensibility for cross-cultural and
collaborative development.

---

## Architectural Rationale

- **Centralized Orchestration:** All post-success and post-error actions (caching, metadata, event
  emission, knowledge graph, scheduler, nexus, audit, alerting, fallback) are managed centrally in
  the `graceful` package.
- **Automatic by Default:** If a custom hook is not provided, graceful runs the default action for
  each orchestration step using the metadata and context in the config.
- **Extensible:** Any step can be overridden with a custom hook, allowing for service-specific or
  culturally-specific logic.
- **Symmetrical (Yin & Yang):** Success and error flows are managed in a mirrored, back-and-forth
  pattern, ensuring consistency and clarity across the codebase.
- **Culturally Robust:** The pattern is clear, explicit, and easy for any team, anywhere in the
  world, to understand and extend. It is informed by global best practices and collaborative input
  from diverse sources (including DeepSeek, GPT, and others).

## Code Usage Example

### Success Orchestration

```go
success := graceful.WrapSuccess(ctx, codes.OK, "user updated", response, nil)
success.StandardOrchestrate(ctx, graceful.SuccessOrchestrationConfig{
    Log:          logger,
    Cache:        cache,
    CacheKey:     user.ID,
    CacheValue:   response,
    CacheTTL:     10 * time.Minute,
    Metadata:     user.Metadata,
    EventEmitter: eventEmitter,
    EventEnabled: eventEnabled,
    EventType:    "user_updated",
    EventID:      user.ID,
    PatternType:  "user",
    PatternID:    user.ID,
    PatternMeta:  user.Metadata,
    // Optionally override any step with a custom hook
    // MetadataHook: func(ctx context.Context) error { ... },
})
```

### Error Orchestration

```go
err := graceful.WrapErr(ctx, codes.Internal, "something failed", cause)
err.StandardOrchestrate(graceful.ErrorOrchestrationConfig{
    Log: logger,
    // Optionally override with custom audit, alert, fallback, etc.
})
```

## Cultural and Collaborative Context

- **Diversity of Perspective:** The pattern is informed by input from multiple AI models, global
  best practices, and real-world engineering experience.
- **Collaboration:** The architecture is designed to be robust to different coding styles, cultural
  values, and team structures.
- **Thesis Material:** This orchestration pattern is suitable for academic discussion, technical
  talks, and as a reference for future extensible backend systems.

---

## Benefits

- **DRY and Consistent:** No more repeated orchestration code in every service.
- **Easy to Extend:** Override any step with a custom hook as needed.
- **Centralized:** All orchestration logic is in one place (graceful).
- **Symmetrical:** Success and error flows are managed in a yin-yang, back-and-forth pattern.
- **Culturally Robust:** Ready for global collaboration and onboarding.
