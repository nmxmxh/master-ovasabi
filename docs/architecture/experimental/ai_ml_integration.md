# Experimental: AI/ML Integration in OVASABI

## Vision

This document explores how advanced AI and machine learning (ML) can be deeply integrated into the OVASABI platform, leveraging Go's performance, concurrency, and modularity. The goal is to create a self-improving, context-aware, and highly automated backend that not only powers business logic, but also enables new forms of intelligence, automation, and user experience.

## Automated Context Capture & AI Onboarding (for Kizuna and Future Collaborators)

To ensure that any future AI assistant (like **Kizuna**) or human contributor can always pick up where the last left off, OVASABI should treat context as a first-class, continuously maintained asset. Here's how to do it:

### 1. **Automated Documentation Generation**

- **Action:** Use code analysis tools and CI/CD hooks to extract service registrations, API endpoints, and dependency graphs automatically.
- **Example:** On every merge, update the Amadeus context file and service network map.
- **Tools:** Go doc generators, custom scripts, Mermaid diagrams, CI jobs.

### 2. **Changelog and Decision Log Extraction**

- **Action:** Automate extraction of changelogs, architectural decisions, and TODOs from PRs, commit messages, and code comments.
- **Example:** Use a bot to append key changes to the Amadeus changelog and highlight open TODOs.
- **Tools:** Git hooks, PR templates, changelog bots.

### 3. **Knowledge Graph Snapshots**

- **Action:** Regularly snapshot the Amadeus knowledge graph (JSON, diagrams) and store historical versions.
- **Example:** Nightly job saves a snapshot to `amadeus/backups` and updates a visual dashboard.
- **Tools:** Scheduled jobs, graph visualization tools, backup scripts.

### 4. **Onboarding Guides for AI/Humans**

- **Action:** Maintain a living onboarding guide that explains the architecture, service patterns, and how to "prime" a new AI assistant with the latest context.
- **Example:** A `docs/onboarding/ai_human.md` file with links to the context, service network, and key docs.
- **Tools:** Markdown docs, onboarding checklists, context export scripts.

### 5. **Context Export/Import APIs**

- **Action:** Expose APIs or CLI tools to export/import the current system context (docs, knowledge graph, service network) for use by new AI assistants or external tools.
- **Example:** `make export-context` produces a zip with all key docs and graph snapshots.
- **Tools:** CLI scripts, REST/gRPC endpoints, Makefile targets.

### 6. **Continuous Feedback Loop**

- **Action:** Encourage every AI/human collaborator to update docs, context, and changelogs as part of their workflow.
- **Example:** Pre-commit hooks or CI checks that require context updates for major changes.

### 7. **Why This Matters**

- **Guarantees continuity:** No matter which AI (or human) is "on duty," the system's knowledge, rationale, and state are always available.
- **Accelerates onboarding:** New contributors (AI or human) can get up to speed in minutes, not weeks.
- **Enables smarter AI:** The richer the context, the more effective and context-aware Kizuna (or any future AI) can be.

## 1. Integration Strategies (with Actionable Steps)

### a. **Embedded ML Inference in Go Services**

- **Action:** Integrate Go ML libraries (e.g., [Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia), [GoLearn](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn), GoMind) into microservices for real-time inference.
- **Example:** Deploy a fraud detection model in the Finance service using GoLearn, serving predictions via gRPC.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify high-impact prediction use cases (fraud, recommendations, anomaly detection).
  2. Train models in Python or Go, export to ONNX or Go-native format.
  3. Use Go ML library to load and serve the model in the relevant service.
  4. Add gRPC endpoints for prediction, and benchmark latency/throughput.
  5. Monitor model performance and retrain as needed.
- **Infra:** Use Go's goroutines to parallelize requests; consider batching for high-throughput endpoints.

### b. **Multi-Agent AI Systems**

- **Action:** Prototype a multi-agent orchestration layer using OpenAI Swarm or similar agentic frameworks.
- **Example:** Agents monitor service health, auto-scale resources, and coordinate incident response.
- **Steps:**
  1. Define agent roles (e.g., health monitor, optimizer, incident responder).
  2. Integrate a Go-based agent framework or connect to Python-based Swarm via gRPC.
  3. Implement agent communication via Redis pub/sub or gRPC streams.
  4. Start with a simple workflow (e.g., auto-restart unhealthy service) and expand.
  5. Log agent actions and measure impact on uptime and MTTR (mean time to recovery).

### c. **Edge ML and Federated Learning**

- **Action:** Enable Go-based ML inference on edge devices (IoT, AR/VR, mobile) and experiment with federated learning.
- **Example:** Deploy a lightweight recommendation model to AR glasses for real-time, on-device suggestions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Select a use case where edge inference adds value (e.g., AR overlays, local anomaly detection).
  2. Use GoCV or GoLearn for on-device inference.
  3. Implement federated learning: devices train locally, send model updates to the cloud for aggregation.
  4. Measure latency, privacy, and bandwidth savings.

### d. **AI-Driven Knowledge Graph**

- **Action:** Use ML to analyze the Amadeus knowledge graph for new relationships, anomalies, and optimization opportunities.
- **Example:** Anomaly detection model flags unusual service dependencies or data flows.
- **Steps:**
  1. Export graph data for analysis (e.g., as JSON or CSV).
  2. Apply graph ML algorithms (e.g., node2vec, GNNs) in Go or Python.
  3. Surface insights in the Amadeus dashboard and suggest code/doc updates.
  4. Automate impact analysis for proposed changes.

### e. **Business AI/ML**

- **Action:** Integrate ML for dynamic pricing, campaign optimization, user segmentation, and churn prediction.
- **Example:** Use GoLearn to segment users and optimize campaign targeting in real time.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify business KPIs that can be improved with ML.
  2. Build and deploy models for pricing, segmentation, or retention.
  3. Integrate predictions into service logic (e.g., via Babel for pricing).
  4. A/B test and measure business impact.

## 4. Inspiration: Den-noh Coil (Vision for OVASABI)

- Imagine OVASABI as a digital-physical mesh, where every service, user, and device is context-aware and adaptive.
- Agents and ML models act as "Den-noh pets" or overlays, surfacing insights, automating tasks, and protecting system integrity.
- The knowledge graph is a living, evolving map—AI/ML keeps it up-to-date, relevant, and actionable.
- The system is resilient, self-healing, and always learning—blurring the line between backend and intelligent assistant.
