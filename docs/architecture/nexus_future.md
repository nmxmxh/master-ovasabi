# Nexus Future Vision: Event-Driven, Scalable, and Extensible Orchestration

## Overview

This document outlines the future direction for Nexus as the central orchestrator and event bus for
OVASABI. It synthesizes recent architectural musings and requirements, focusing on how Nexus can
evolve to support:

- Event-driven microservices
- Pluggable message bus backends (Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ)
- High scalability, durability, and reliability
- Decoupling of producers and consumers
- Rich ecosystem integrations
- Increased worker pools and concurrency handling

## 1. Evolving Nexus into an Event Bus

- **From Orchestrator to Event Bus:**
  - Nexus will emit and consume events, not just orchestrate via direct calls or hooks.
  - All services will publish significant events (e.g., `user_registered`, `content_posted`,
    `order_placed`) to Nexus.
  - Nexus will route, store, and distribute events to interested consumers (other services,
    analytics, external integrations).
  - Workflows and patterns can be defined as event-driven chains, not just imperative orchestration.

---

## 2. Pluggable Backend Support

- **Why Consider a Pluggable Backend?**

  1. **Scalability & Throughput:**
     - Message brokers like Kafka, NATS, and RabbitMQ are designed to handle millions of messages
       per second with durability and partitioning.
     - As the platform grows (users, services, integrations, real-time features), a dedicated broker
       prevents bottlenecks.
  2. **Durability & Reliability:**
     - These systems persist events to disk, allowing for replay, recovery, and guaranteed
       delivery—even if services crash or restart.
     - Current Go/gRPC patterns are fast but typically in-memory and synchronous—if a service is
       down, messages/events can be lost.
  3. **Decoupling & Flexibility:**
     - A message bus decouples producers and consumers: services don't need to know about each other
       or be online at the same time.
     - You can add, remove, or update services without impacting others.
  4. **Ecosystem & Integrations:**
     - Kafka, NATS, and RabbitMQ have rich ecosystems: connectors for databases, analytics, ML,
       external partners, etc.
     - This makes it easy to integrate with third-party tools or scale out new features.

- **How Nexus Would Adapt:**
  - Design Nexus with a pluggable interface for event storage and delivery.
  - Start with an internal, in-memory event bus for rapid development.
  - Allow seamless migration to Kafka, NATS, or RabbitMQ as scale and durability needs grow.
  - Expose configuration for backend selection and tuning.

## 3. Scaling Worker Pools & Concurrency Handling

- **Worker Pools:**
  - Nexus will manage pools of workers for event processing, allowing parallel handling of high
    event volumes.
  - Worker pool size and concurrency can be tuned dynamically based on load and backend
    capabilities.
- **Concurrency Handling:**
  - Ensure thread-safe event processing and delivery.
  - Support backpressure and rate limiting to prevent overload.
  - Implement retry, dead-letter queues, and idempotency for robust event handling.

## 4. Technical Adaptations for Requirements

| Requirement   | Nexus Adaptation                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability   | Pluggable backend, dynamic worker pools, partitioned event topics       |
| Durability    | Persistent event storage (disk, broker), replay and recovery mechanisms |
| Decoupling    | Event-driven contracts, async delivery, pub/sub APIs                    |
| Flexibility   | Pluggable backend, dynamic subscriptions, extensible event schemas      |
| Ecosystem     | Connectors for analytics, ML, external partners, and data lakes         |
| Real-Time     | Low-latency event routing, WebSocket and push integration               |
| Observability | Tracing, logging, metrics for event flows and worker pools              |

## 5. Migration and Incremental Adoption

- **Start Simple:**
  - Begin with in-memory event bus and Go worker pools for rapid prototyping.
- **Design for Pluggability:**
  - Abstract event storage and delivery behind interfaces.
- **Incremental Migration:**
  - Gradually introduce Kafka/NATS/RabbitMQ as backend options.
  - Refactor services to emit and consume events via Nexus.
- **Monitor and Tune:**
  - Use observability tools to monitor event throughput, latency, and worker utilization.

## 6. Future-Proofing Nexus

- **Unified Orchestration & Eventing:**
  - Nexus becomes the single source of truth for both orchestration and event flows.
- **Extensibility:**
  - New services, analytics, and integrations can subscribe to events without modifying existing
    code.
- **Auditability & Replay:**
  - All events are logged and can be replayed for debugging, analytics, or compliance.
- **Global Scale:**
  - Partitioned topics, distributed worker pools, and multi-region support for global deployments.

**Nexus, as a future event bus and orchestrator, will be the backbone of a scalable, resilient, and
extensible OVASABI platform.**
