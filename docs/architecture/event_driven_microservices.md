# Event-Driven Microservices (EDA) for OVASABI

## What is Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)?

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design paradigm where services communicate by producing and
consuming events via a message bus (such as Kafka, NATS, or RabbitMQ), rather than direct
synchronous calls (e.g., HTTP/gRPC). Each event represents a significant change or action in the
system (e.g., "user_registered", "order_placed", "coin_mined").

## Why Adopt EDA?

- **Decoupling:** Services are loosely coupled, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale them
  independently.
- **Scalability & Resilience:** The message bus buffers and distributes events, allowing the system
  to handle spikes and failures gracefully.
- **Real-Time Features:** Enables real-time feeds, notifications, analytics, moderation, and more by
  reacting instantly to events.
- **Extensibility:** New services (e.g., ML, fraud detection, external integrations) can be added by
  simply subscribing to relevant events, without changing existing code.
- **Auditability:** All significant actions are logged as events, providing a clear audit trail.

## What Would EDA Mean for OVASABI?

### Technical Implications

- **Message Bus Integration:**
  - Deploy and manage a message broker (Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ, etc.).
  - Define event schemas and topics (e.g., "user.events", "content.events").
- **Service Refactoring:**
  - Refactor services to publish events for significant actions (e.g., user creation, content post,
    payment).
  - Refactor services to consume events for workflows, analytics, notifications, etc.
- **Event Schemas & Contracts:**
  - Define and document event payloads (using JSON Schema, Protobuf, or Avro).
  - Version event schemas for backward compatibility.
- **Error Handling & Idempotency:**
  - Ensure event consumers handle duplicate or out-of-order events safely.
- **Monitoring & Observability:**
  - Add tracing, logging, and monitoring for event flows and message bus health.

### Adoption Implications

- **Development Workflow:**
  - Teams can develop and deploy services independently, as long as they adhere to event contracts.
  - Enables parallel development and faster onboarding of new teams/services.
- **Operational Overhead:**
  - Requires new operational skills (message bus management, event debugging).
  - Adds complexity, but also brings significant long-term benefits.
- **Ecosystem Growth:**
  - Makes it easy to add new features, integrations, and external partners by subscribing to events.
- **Migration Path:**
  - Can be adopted incrementally: start by emitting events from core services, then refactor
    consumers over time.

## Example Use Cases in OVASABI

- **Real-Time Notifications:** Send notifications when relevant events occur (e.g., new message,
  order shipped).
- **Live Analytics:** Update dashboards and metrics in real time as events are processed.
- **Moderation & Security:** Trigger moderation workflows or fraud detection on suspicious events.
- **External Integrations:** Allow partners or mini-apps to react to platform events without direct
  API calls.

## Summary

Adopting EDA with a message bus will make OVASABI more scalable, resilient, and extensible. It
enables real-time features, simplifies integration of new services, and future-proofs the platform
for growth and innovation.
