# Article 1: Knowledge Graph-Driven Architecture for Modern Backends

> **Draft**

## Abstract

This article explores how knowledge graph-driven architecture transforms backend platforms, enabling modularity, observability, and AI-readiness. Using OVASABI/Amadeus as a case study, we demonstrate how a persistent, self-documenting knowledge graph can orchestrate and document all services, relationships, and system evolution.

## Introduction

Traditional backend architectures struggle with complexity, service sprawl, and lack of systemic insight. By adopting a knowledge graph as the architectural backbone, platforms gain a living map of all components, dependencies, and data flows—empowering both humans and AI to reason about the system.

## Why Knowledge Graphs?

- Capture relationships and dependencies explicitly
- Enable impact analysis and change prediction
- Support self-documentation and automated visualization
- Provide a foundation for AI-driven insights
- Facilitate automated compliance and governance

## System Overview

The OVASABI platform uses Amadeus, a knowledge graph that tracks all services, their registrations, dependencies, and capabilities. All services are registered via a Provider/DI container, ensuring modularity and single registration. The knowledge graph is stored in a JSON file and accessed via a Go API.

## Implementation Patterns

- Layered architecture: Proto → Service → Repository → DB/Redis
- Centralized service registration
- Automated documentation and visualization
- Service hooks for real-time updates
- CI/CD integration for validation

## Impact on Modularity & Observability

- Single source of truth for all services
- Real-time health and metrics tracking
- Easy onboarding and impact analysis
- Automated relationship and dependency diagrams

## Case Study: OVASABI/Amadeus

Amadeus maintains a JSON-based knowledge graph, updated via service hooks, CI/CD, and manual tools. It powers documentation, diagrams, and impact analysis. The system supports versioning, backups, and rollback.

### Example: Service Registration in the Knowledge Graph

```go
// Registering a service in Amadeus KG
type ServiceRegistration struct {
    Name         string
    Version      string
    Capabilities []string
    Dependencies []string
    Endpoints    []EndpointInfo
}

amadeusKG.RegisterService(ServiceRegistration{
    Name: "QuotesService",
    Version: "v1.2.0",
    Capabilities: []string{"quote-generation", "pricing"},
    Dependencies: []string{"BabelService", "UserService"},
    Endpoints: []EndpointInfo{/* ... */},
})
```

## Diagrams & Data Flows

### Layered Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Proto Layer] -->|Defines Contract| B[Service Layer]
    B -->|Uses| C[Repository Layer]
    C -->|Accesses| D[Database]
    C -->|Caches| E[Redis]
    F[Amadeus KG] -->|Tracks| B
    F -->|Monitors| C
    G[Provider/DI] -->|Resolves| B
    H[Babel Service] -->|Provides Pricing/i18n| B
```

### Service Relationships
```mermaid

    QuotesService -->|uses| BabelService
    FinanceService -->|uses| BabelService
    CampaignService -->|uses| BabelService
    NotificationService -->|notifies| UserService
    BroadcastService -->|publishes| NotificationService
    AssetService -->|references| UserService
    AuthService -->|validates| UserService
    ReferralService -->|uses| CampaignService
    ReferralService -->|rewards| FinanceService
```

## Lessons Learned

- Invest in self-documenting systems early
- Make relationships explicit for AI and humans
- Automate as much as possible
- Use versioning and backups for safety

## Conclusion

Knowledge graph-driven architecture is a powerful pattern for modern, extensible, and observable backends. OVASABI/Amadeus demonstrates its real-world value.
