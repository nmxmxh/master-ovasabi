## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive, service-by-service summary of known edge cases, caveats,
security concerns, and best practices for the OVASABI platform. It is intended as a living reference
for engineers, architects, and reviewers to ensure robust, secure, and production-grade service
implementations. All findings are based on codebase analysis, platform standards, and industry
research.

# User Service

**Responsibilities:** User management, authentication, authorization, RBAC, audit logging.

### Edge Cases & Caveats

- Race conditions on simultaneous profile updates.
- Token/session revocation delays (e.g., cache invalidation lag).
- Account lockout from brute-force protection (risk of locking out legitimate users).
- Incomplete propagation of role/permission changes in distributed systems.
- Stale or inconsistent user metadata due to eventual consistency.

### Security Concerns

- Ensure all authentication tokens are securely generated, stored, and invalidated.
- Enforce strong password and MFA policies.
- Log and monitor all authentication and permission changes (audit trail).
- Protect against enumeration attacks (e.g., timing attacks on login).
- Implement bad actor detection (see
  [Bad Actor Identification Standard](../amadeus/amadeus_context.md#bad-actor-identification-standard)).

### Best Practices

- Use the canonical metadata pattern for all user-related actions and events.
- Always propagate versioning and environment fields in metadata.
- Integrate with Security and Notification services for audit and alerts.
- Use RBAC for all sensitive actions; never hardcode roles/permissions.
