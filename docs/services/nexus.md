# Nexus Service Documentation

## Overview

The **Nexus Service** is the platform's high-level **orchestration and composition layer**. It acts
as the "brain" of the system, responsible for:

- Composing and orchestrating workflows across multiple services and domains
- Identifying, registering, and evolving patterns (business, technical, data, and interaction)
- Coordinating distributed processes and ensuring system-wide consistency
- Enabling adaptive, data-driven, and explainable automation
- Serving as the integration point for AI/ML-driven orchestration and pattern mining

**Nexus is a meta-service for system intelligence and coordination, not a business logic service.**

---

## Core Capabilities

1. **Pattern Registration & Discovery**
   - Register new patterns (workflows, data flows, business rules, AI/ML models)
   - Discover and mine patterns from system events, logs, and metadata
   - Version, annotate, and evolve patterns over time
2. **Orchestration & Composition**
   - Compose multi-service workflows (across domains: user, content, security, etc.)
   - Dynamically adapt orchestration based on context, metadata, and learned patterns
   - Support both declarative (YAML/DSL) and programmatic (API) orchestration
3. **Pattern Analytics & Explainability**
   - Analyze usage, performance, and impact of patterns
   - Provide explainable traces of orchestration decisions
   - Enable feedback loops for pattern refinement and system learning
4. **Integration & Extensibility**
   - Integrate with all core services (User, Security, Content, Campaign, etc.)
   - Expose APIs for pattern registration, orchestration requests, and analytics
   - Support AI/ML-driven orchestration and pattern mining

## Separation of Concerns

| Responsibility       | Nexus Service (Composer)                 | Other Services (Domain Logic)      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Pattern Registration | ✅ (all types: workflow, data, AI, etc.) | ❌ (registers with Nexus)          |
| Orchestration        | ✅ (cross-service, adaptive)             | ❌ (executes domain logic only)    |
| Pattern Mining       | ✅ (from events, logs, metadata)         | ❌                                 |
| Explainability       | ✅ (trace, analytics, feedback)          | ❌                                 |
| Domain Logic         | ❌                                       | ✅ (user, content, security, etc.) |

## API & Proto Summary

- **RegisterPattern:** Register a new pattern (workflow, data flow, etc.)
- **ListPatterns:** List all registered patterns, with metadata and usage stats
- **Orchestrate:** Request orchestration of a workflow or process
- **TracePattern:** Get an explainable trace of a pattern execution
- **MinePatterns:** Trigger or query pattern mining from system data
- **Feedback:** Submit feedback or corrections for pattern refinement

See [`api/protos/nexus/v1/nexus_service.proto`](../../api/protos/nexus/v1/nexus_service.proto) for
full proto definition.

## Nexus Metadata Pattern

Extend the platform's metadata with a **nexus-specific namespace**:

```json
{
  "service_specific": {
    "nexus": {
      "pattern_id": "pattern_abc123",
      "pattern_type": "workflow",
      "version": "1.0.2",
      "origin": "mined",
      "explainability": {
        "trace_id": "trace_xyz789",
        "steps": [
          { "service": "user", "action": "create" },
          { "service": "content", "action": "publish" }
        ]
      },
      "feedback": {
        "score": 0.95,
        "comments": "Pattern is efficient and robust"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Integration Patterns

- **All services** register their patterns and workflows with Nexus
- **Nexus** orchestrates cross-service workflows, invoking domain services as needed
- **Pattern mining** is triggered by system events, logs, and metadata
- **Explainability** and analytics are available for all orchestrations

## Summary Table: Nexus Service Responsibilities

| Capability       | Description                                 | Integration Points             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Pattern Registry | Register, version, and annotate patterns    | All services, AI/ML, analytics |
| Orchestration    | Compose and execute cross-service workflows | All services, API gateway      |
| Pattern Mining   | Discover and evolve patterns from data      | Events, logs, metadata         |
| Explainability   | Trace and explain orchestration decisions   | SRE, compliance, analytics     |
| Feedback Loop    | Accept feedback for pattern refinement      | All services, UI, analytics    |

---

## Change Management

- All new orchestration or workflow patterns must be registered with Nexus
- Any new field in `service_specific.nexus` must be documented here and referenced in the metadata
  standard

---

## Onboarding Guidance

- Engineers should use the Nexus API to register, orchestrate, and trace patterns.
- All cross-service workflows must be defined as patterns and registered with Nexus.
- Use the metadata pattern for all pattern-related context and explainability.
- Review the proto file and this documentation before implementing new orchestration logic.
