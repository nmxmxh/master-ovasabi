## Service Patterns

All services follow these common patterns:

1. **Data Storage**

   - Master-client pattern
   - JSONB for flexible fields
   - Event logging table

2. **Caching**

   - Redis for transient data
   - Structured key naming
   - TTL management

3. **API Design**

   - gRPC interfaces
   - Protocol Buffers
   - Versioned APIs

4. **Documentation**

   - Amadeus integration
   - Generated docs
   - Example usage

5. **Monitoring**
   - Health checks
   - Metrics
   - Tracing

   - Advanced analytics

## Service Health

Current service health status is tracked in Amadeus and can be queried:

```go
health, err := amadeus.GetServiceHealth(ctx, &kg.HealthRequest{
    Services: []string{"finance", "user", "auth"},
})
```

## Documentation

Each service maintains its own documentation:

- Implementation details
- API reference
- Usage examples
- Integration guide
- Testing guide

Documentation is automatically generated and updated through Amadeus.

**All services are registered and resolved via a central Provider using a DI container. Modular
registration ensures each service is only registered once. Health and metrics are managed centrally
and exposed for observability. Amadeus registration is performed at service startup for capability
tracking.**

**The Babel service provides i18n and dynamic, location-based pricing rules. Quotes, Finance, and
Campaign services integrate with Babel for pricing and localization.**

NotificationService now consolidates all messaging, broadcast, and event delivery logic.

- **ContentService**: Provides dynamic content (articles, micro-posts, video), comments, reactions,
  and full-text search. Integrates with UserService for author info, NotificationService for
  engagement, SearchService for indexing, and ContentModerationService for compliance.

> **Note:** AdminService always creates/links admin users to main users via UserService gRPC. All
> cross-service relationships are via gRPC and DI. No direct DB access is allowed across service
> boundaries.
