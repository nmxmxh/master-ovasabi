# AWS Deployment Summary

## üéØ What's Ready

Your Master Ovasabi application is now **fully configured and ready for AWS deployment**. Here's
what has been set up:

### ‚úÖ Environment Configuration

- **Standardized** all environment variables across all services
- **Validated** configuration consistency with automated scripts
- **Secured** passwords and sensitive data management
- **Fixed** Docker build issues (distroless image problems resolved)

### ‚úÖ AWS Infrastructure Setup

- **Complete CloudFormation templates** for VPC, RDS, Redis, ECS, Load Balancer
- **ECR repository** configuration for Docker images
- **Security groups** and networking properly configured
- **Auto-scaling** and monitoring setup included

### ‚úÖ Deployment Automation

- **One-command deployment** script (`deploy-full.sh`)
- **Makefile targets** for easy management
- **Validation scripts** to check prerequisites
- **Monitoring and logging** setup

## üöÄ How to Deploy (3 Options)

### Option 1: One-Command Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Configure AWS CLI (one-time setup)
aws configure

# 2. Deploy everything with one command
make aws-deploy
```

### Option 2: Using the Direct Script

```bash
# 1. Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# 2. Run the deployment script
./deployments/aws/deploy-full.sh
```

### Option 3: Step-by-Step Manual\

```bash
# Follow the detailed guide
open deployments/aws/SETUP-GUIDE.md
```

## üìã What the Deployment Includes

### Infrastructure (Automatically Created)

- **VPC** with public/private subnets
- **RDS PostgreSQL** database (db.t3.micro)
- **ElastiCache Redis** (cache.t3.micro)
- **Application Load Balancer** with health checks
- **ECS Fargate cluster** for container orchestration
- **CloudWatch** logging and monitoring
- **Secrets Manager** for secure password storage

### Application Services

- **Main Application** (master-ovasabi)
- **Nexus Service** (orchestration)
- **WebSocket Gateway** (real-time communication)
- **Media Streaming** (content delivery)
- **Nginx** (reverse proxy/static files)

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

**Monthly Cost (Basic Setup):**

- ECS Fargate (1 task): ~$15
- RDS PostgreSQL: ~$15
- ElastiCache Redis: ~$15
- Application Load Balancer: ~$20
- **Total: ~$65/month**

## üõ†Ô∏è Management Commands

After deployment, use these commands for management:

```bash
# Check deployment status
make aws-status

# View application logs
make aws-logs

# Scale the application
make aws-scale

# Get deployment info
make aws-info

# Clean up everything
make aws-cleanup
```

## üìä Monitoring & Access

After successful deployment, you'll get:

- **Application URL**: `http://your-load-balancer.af-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Accessible via AWS Console
- **ECS Management**: Scale and manage via AWS Console or CLI
- **Database Access**: Secure RDS instance with automated backups

## üîß Configuration Details

### Environment Variables (All Standardized)

```bash
# Database
DB_HOST=your-rds-endpoint
DB_NAME=master_ovasabi
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=<auto-generated-secure>

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=your-redis-endpoint
REDIS_PASSWORD=<auto-generated-secure>

# Application
APP_ENV=production
HTTP_PORT=8080
GRPC_PORT=8081

# AWS
AWS_REGION=af-south-1
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=322424815667
```

### Security Features

- **Encrypted passwords** stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **VPC isolation** with private subnets for databases
- **Security groups** with minimal required access
- **HTTPS ready** (certificate can be added to load balancer)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **AWS CLI not configured**

   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Enter your AWS credentials
   ```

2. **Docker not running**

   ```bash
   docker info  # Should show Docker info
   ```

3. **Permission errors**

   - Ensure your AWS user has permissions for ECS, ECR, RDS, VPC

4. **Region issues**

   - Script uses `af-south-1` (Africa - Cape Town)
   - Change `AWS_REGION` environment variable if needed

5. **Deployment stuck**

   ```bash
   # Check CloudFormation in AWS Console
   # Look for failed resources and error messages
   ```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Validate your environment
./scripts/validate-env.sh

# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Test Docker
docker ps
```

## üìö Documentation

- **Quick Start**: `deployments/aws/QUICK-START.md`
- **Detailed Setup**: `deployments/aws/SETUP-GUIDE.md`
- **Environment Validation**: `scripts/validate-env.sh`
- **Configuration Cleanup**: `scripts/cleanup-config.sh`

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run `make aws-deploy` to deploy to AWS
2. **Test**: Access your application URL after deployment
3. **Monitor**: Use CloudWatch and ECS console for monitoring
4. **Scale**: Use `make aws-scale` to increase/decrease capacity
5. **Iterate**: Update code, rebuild, and redeploy as needed

Your application is **production-ready** and **AWS-optimized**! üöÄ
