// Canonical Payload Pattern for Event Bus and Cross-Service Communication
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// This proto defines the standard Payload message for all event bus, orchestration,
// and cross-service communication in the OVASABI platform. It is inspired by the
// robust Metadata pattern and is designed for extensibility, traceability, and
// interoperability across all services.
//
// - Use `data` for arbitrary business data (hydrated state, results, etc.).
// - Use `versioning` for traceability, compliance, and future-proofing.
// - All event bus and orchestration messages should use this Payload as the standard.
//
// For more, see docs/services/metadata.md and docs/amadeus/amadeus_context.md.
